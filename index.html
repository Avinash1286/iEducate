            <p class="para-small-text">Education can be thought of as the transmission of the values and accumulated
                knowledge of a society. In this sense, it is equivalent to what social scientists term socialization or
                enculturation. Children—whether conceived among New Guinea tribespeople, the Renaissance Florentines, or
                the middle classes of Manhattan—are born without culture. Education is designed to guide them in
                learning a culture, molding their behaviour in the ways of adulthood, and directing them toward their
                eventual role in society.</p>

            <p class="para-small-text">The most famous example being the passion of Jesus Christ. This definition has
                changed my perspective on passion. I no longer use it to describe something that I feel strongly about
                or that excites me. I use it to describe an activity, goal or cause that I care about so much that I am
                willing to suffer for it. This new standard makes it easier to discern whether something is truly my
                passion or simply a strong interest.</p>

            <p class="para-big-text">Here Is Your Success</p>
            <p class="para-small-text">There are many ways in the world to be successful. But most people think of
                celebrities, artist, politicians, and businessmen whenever they heard the word success.

                Moreover, they think doing what they will make you successful but that not the case. They forget the
                most basic thing that makes a person successful that is their hard work, dedication, and the desire to
                achieve their dream. More importantly, they what they like to do not what that others told them to do.
                Successful people do what they like to do also they do what they feel correct for their business.
